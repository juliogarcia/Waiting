Overview
--------
Waiting is a command line tool to track who or what you are waiting on
or keeping you from completing a task. The data you submit is stored in
a plain text file in YAML format.

I created this tool because I am often waiting on others to complete
something before I can move forward. While there are to-do or reminder
apps, I needed something like this to track people blocking me from 
finishing projects, or people I needed a reply/response from.

Documentation
-------------
to start tracking someone, type: for <name> to "<action>" 
- keep <action> in quotes, <name> should be in quotes for multiple people
ex. ./waiting.rb for Julio to "finish writing his README"

to delete, type: delete <id>
ex. ./waiting.rb delete 392

to view status of what you're waiting on, simply type: status
